  <h1>Transit and Healthcare Accessibility in Toronto's Filipino Communities</h1>
  <h2>Francis Emmanuel Calingo</h2>

<div id="INTRODUCTION" align="left">
 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><font size="4">For my project, I am focusing on Toronto, the city that I have lived in for over 20 years. Not only is the diversity of the city makes it an interesting case study for 
spatial analysis, but my familiarity with its human and physical geography makes it an easy choice for my very first GIS project. Being a Filipino immigrant myself, 
I wanted to observe and analyze a brief snapshot of the five federal Toronto ridings (2013 representation order) that have the highest per-capita Filipino population 
based on the 2021 Census, and map out its relationships with hospital locations and transit lines.By doing so, I hope to map out and analyze any potential patterns that 
can utilized when discussing transit accessibility and health inequalities affecting the cityâ€™s Filipino community.</p>
</div>

<div id="METHODOLOGY" align="left">
 <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<p><font size="4">Using ArcGIS Pro, I will map the said five federal ridings by digitizing polygons on a satellite basemap of Toronto. I will also digitize 10 red lines that roughly map the 
Toronto Transit Commission's 10 busiest bus routes from 2023 based on ridership, as well as several points (each represented by a health symbol) that map out the locations of hospitals 
officially under "Ontario Health Toronto".</font></p>

<img src="https://coursera-assessments.s3.amazonaws.com/assessments/1731125207555/7ab6ee9d-85e4-4195-bb4c-e9a9e59fc9d1/Brief%20Snapshot%20of%20Filipino%20Community%20in%20Toronto.jpeg" 
alt="Stellite basemap image of Toronto. The following three map elements have been layerd on top of it: (1) 5 digitized shapes representing the 5 aforementioned ridings, each with different shades
of blue to represent different per-capita Filipino populations (2) 10 digitized red lines representing the 10 busiest bus routes in Toronto (3) Several heart inside white circle icons scattered
across the map representing Toronto's hospital, with a higher density of them in downtown Toronto." width="1400" height="900"/>

<p><font size="2"> <i> <b>IMAGE DESCRIPTION:</b>Satellite map of Toronto. 5 digitized blue polygons representing the 5 federal ridings in Toronto that have the highest per-capita Filipino population (per 2021 Census).
 Darker blue shades represent higher percentage, and lighter blue shades represent lower percentage. 10 digitized red lines with labels represent the 10 busiest bus routes from 2023 by ridership. Several digitized points (heart symbol in white circle) represent locations of hospitals in Toronto. Attribute table of the 
10 lines is shown, with the list going in ascending order from 10th busiest to most busiest.</font></i></p>

<p><font size="4"> Notice that they are concentrated in Toronto's northern suburb (North York) and eastern suburb (Scarborough). Observe that 7 of the 10 busiest routes traverse the highlighted ridings, and two
more straddling one or more of their borders. Also observe that the hospitals are more concentrated in the downtown while they become more sparse in the suburbs, especially in Scarborough, despite the fact that well over half a million people live in Scarborough.
</p>

<p><font size="4">While the analysis and mapping is elementary and not very comprehensive, it does raise some questions about transit accessibility and healthcare inequality. There are of course many factors 
that go behind the deployment of buses, as well as higher ridership numbers, but given that many Filipinos, like many immigrant groups in Toronto, rely on public transit, one has to wonder if 
resources are being allocated equitably. The same could be said for healthcare. While the lower density of hospitals doesn't necessarily mean poorer health quality (and hospitals are by no means monolithic), it once again raises questions about whether healthcare is accessible enough in Scarborough. As seen from the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains inequalities in healthcare
that disproportionately impacts migrant and BIPOC communities, making the analysis of the locations of hospitals across Toronto more important. </p>
